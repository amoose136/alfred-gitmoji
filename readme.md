## GitMoji
Some Alfred Snippets to make putting the true unicode equivalents of things like :sparkles:, :lipstick:, and other emojis used it git comments easier to type. It gives them names relavent to coding.
Example: `:sparkles:` -> `:new:` Because one uses it when adding new features
`:penguin:` -> `:linux:` Because one uses it when making linux related changes
`:checkered_flag:` -> `:windows:` Because one uses it when for windows related changes
`:heavy_plus_sign:` -> `:+dep:` Because one uses it when adding dependancies

etc

Added benefit of making emojis appear with `$git log` because they are just unicode after using this.
